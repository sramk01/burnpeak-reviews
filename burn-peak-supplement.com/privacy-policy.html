        <h1 class="fw-bold">Privacy Policy For BurnPeak</h1>
        <p class="mt-4">
          This Privacy Policy outlines how BurnPeak ("we" or "us") collects,
          uses, and manages your personal information when you visit our website
          https://burn-peak-supplement.com (the "Site"). It details the types of
          information we collect from you during your online interaction with us
          and how we utilize that information. Please note that this policy does
          not apply to information gathered offline or through other means, such
          as phone, mail, or live events.
          <br /><br />
          Privacy Notice for Refund Video Statements<br />
          If you choose to submit a video statement as part of your refund
          request, please note:<br />
          <br /><br />
          Purpose of collection: Your video will be used solely to validate and
          process your refund request.<br />
          Who will review it: Only our customer support and quality assurance
          teams will have access to your video. It will not be shared with third
          parties.<br /><br />
          Storage & security: Videos are stored securely on our internal system
          and protected against unauthorized access.<br /><br />
          Retention period: Your video will be retained only for as long as
          necessary to process your refund request and any related customer
          service follow-up, after which it will be permanently deleted. The
          maximum retention period is 1 month. Submitting a video is
          optional.<br /><br />
          Acceptance and Changes to the Privacy Policy<br />
          By using this Site, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
          As the online environment evolves, we may update this policy in the
          future. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated
          "Effective Date." Your continued use of the Site signifies acceptance
          of any modifications made to this policy.
          <br /><br />
          How We Collect and Use Information<br />
          We may collect and store personal information you provide while using
          the Site (e.g., during registration, purchases, or when subscribing to
          our content). The information may include your name, email address,
          postal address, and payment details. This data is submitted
          voluntarily by you.
          <br /><br />
          Additionally, we may collect data that is generated automatically as
          you browse the Site, such as information about your device's
          connection to the Internet, which helps us enhance your browsing
          experience and monitor site traffic. We may use cookies and web
          beacons to collect information. Cookies are small files placed on your
          device to help us track usage patterns, deliver targeted
          advertisements, and save your preferences. Web beacons (also known as
          "transparent GIFs") may be used to monitor site traffic or count users
          who have opened certain emails.
          <br /><br />
          We use the collected data to customize features, send you relevant
          offers, and provide you with tailored advertising through various
          means, including email, direct mail, phone, or SMS. We may also share
          your information with trusted third parties, such as service providers
          or advertisers. If you do not want us to use your information for
          these purposes, you can request removal by contacting our Online
          Privacy Coordinator at the address provided at the end of this policy.
          <br /><br />
          Please be cautious when sharing your personal information on public
          forums, message boards, or chat areas on the Site, as we cannot
          control how others may use that information.
          <br /><br />
          What Information We Collect<br /><br />
          We may collect and store personal or other information that you
          voluntarily supply to us online while using the Site (e.g., while on
          the Site or in responding via email to a feature provided on the
          Site). The Site only contacts individuals who specifically request
          that we do so or in the event that they have signed up to receive our
          messaging, attended one of our events, or have purchased one of our
          products. The Site collects personally identifying information from
          our users during online registration and online purchasing. Generally,
          this information includes name and e-mail address for registration or
          opt-in purposes and name, postal address, and credit card information
          when registering for our events or purchasing our products. All of
          this information is provided to us by you.
          <br /><br />
          We also collect and store information that is generated automatically
          as you navigate online through the Site. For example, we may collect
          information about your computer’s connection to the Internet, which
          allows us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our web
          pages to you and to measure traffic on the Site. We also may use a
          standard feature found in browser software called a “cookie” to
          enhance your experience with the Site. Cookies are small files that
          your web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping
          purposes. By showing how and when visitors use the Site, cookies help
          us deliver advertisements, identify how many unique users visit us,
          and track user trends and patterns. They also prevent you from having
          to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of the Site where you
          may have entered preference information before. The Site also may use
          web beacons (single-pixel graphic files also known as “transparent
          GIFs”) to access cookies and to count users who visit the Site or open
          HTML-formatted email messages.
          <br /><br />
          No Information Collected from Children: We will never knowingly
          collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If
          we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected Personal Information
          about a child under the age of 13, that information will be
          immediately deleted from its database.
          <br /><br />
          No sensitive medical information is collected: We do not collect
          information about past, present or potential future medical conditions
          or treatments.
          <br /><br />
          Credit Card Information and Bank Account Information: We may, in
          certain instances, collect credit card number(s), bank account
          information and related information, when you place an order on our
          website. When the credit card or bank account information is submitted
          to us, such information is encrypted and is protected with SSL
          encryption software. We will use the credit card information or bank
          account information for purposes of processing and completing the
          transaction you requested. Such information will be disclosed to third
          parties as necessary to complete the requested purchase transaction.
          <br /><br />
          How We Store Your Information<br />
          Your information is stored at the list server that delivers the Site
          content and messaging. Your information can only be accessed by those
          who help manage those lists in order to deliver e-mail to those who
          would like to receive the Site material.
          <br /><br />
          All of the messaging or emails that are sent to you by the Site
          include an unsubscribe link in them. You can remove yourself at any
          time from our mailing list by clicking on the unsubscribe link that
          can be found in every communication that we send you.
          <br /><br />
          We endeavor to safeguard and protect your information. When you submit
          information on our website, such information is protected both online
          and offline. We have security measures in place to protect against the
          loss, misuse, and alteration of personal information under our
          control. The servers in which we store your information are kept in a
          secure physical environment. The servers have industry standard
          firewalls. Access to such servers is password protected and access by
          our employees is limited. Currently, we use Secure Socket Layer
          software (“SSL”) to protect data and to secure any transactions. SSL
          encrypts information including credit card number(s), and names and
          addresses, as they are transmitted over the Internet. Please be
          advised that, although we take commercially reasonable technological
          precautions to protect your data, no data transmission over the
          Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure; therefore, we cannot and
          do not warrant that your information will be absolutely secure. Any
          transmission of data at or through our website is at your own risk.
          However, access to your information is strictly limited and not
          accessible to the public.
          <br /><br />
          Changes to Privacy Policy<br />
          We reserve the right to make material changes to the substance of this
          Privacy Policy. We will post those changes through a prominent notice
          on the website, so that you will always know what information we
          gather, how we might use that information, and to whom we will
          disclose it.
          <br /><br />
          California Residential Rights<br />
          California residents have the right to receive, once a year,
          information about third parties with whom we have shared information
          about you or your family for their marketing purposes during the
          previous calendar year, and a description of the categories of
          personal information shared. In addition California residents have the
          right to know if we respond to do not track signals or cookies. We do
          not respond to such signals or cookies.
          <br /><br />
          As stated in this Policy, you have agreed to allow us to share
          information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes
          until you remove your information; and thus, you have agreed to this
          disclosure. Please note that we are only required to respond to one
          request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to
          requests made by means other than through this email address.
          <br /><br />
          Sharing Information with Others<br />
          We share your information with third parties who help us in the
          delivery of the products and services you have requested. We share
          your information with companies and individuals we employ to perform
          technical functions on our behalf. Examples include third parties who
          host our website, analyze our data, provide marketing assistance,
          process credit card payments, and provide customer service. We share
          your information with third parties who will provide you with their
          opportunities, products or services. This includes your personal and
          non-personal information, and includes your interests and preferences,
          so they may determine whether you might be interested in their
          products or services. We share aggregated anonymous information about
          you, combined with other persons using our website with third parties,
          so that they can understand the kinds of visitors that come to our
          website, and how those visitors use our website. This includes
          demographic information and behavioral information.
          <br /><br />
          We disclose your information if legally required to do so, or at our
          discretion, pursuant to a request from a governmental entity, or if we
          believe in good faith that such action is necessary to (a) conform to
          legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect our
          rights or property, or our affiliated companies; (c) prevent a crime
          or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of
          users or the public.
          <br /><br />
          Finally, we may disclose and transfer your information to a third
          party who acquires any or all of our business, whether such
          acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation or purchase of all or a
          substantial portion of our assets. In the event we become the subject
          of an insolvency proceeding, whether voluntary or involuntary, we or
          our liquidator, administrator, receiver or administrative receiver may
          sell, license or otherwise dispose of, such information in a
          transaction approved by the court.
          <br /><br />
          Third Party Collection and Use of Information<br />
          Our Site may include advertisements from third-party advertisers who
          may use cookies, email, or web beacons to collect information about
          your browsing habits. These third-party advertisers have their privacy
          policies, which may differ from ours. We encourage you to review their
          privacy policies if you have any concerns.
          <br /><br />
          The Site may also contain links to external websites, and if you
          access these third-party sites, their privacy policies govern how they
          handle your information. We are not responsible for the privacy
          practices or content of these external websites.
          <br /><br />
          Third parties collect and use information about you on or through our
          website in the following ways:
          <br /><br />
          Advertisers: Advertising agencies, advertising networks, and other
          companies who place ads on our website may use their own cookies, Web
          beacons, and other technology to collect information about you. We do
          not control the use of such technology and have no responsibility for
          the use of such technology to gather information about you.
          Hyperlinks: Our website and email messages sometimes contain hypertext
          links to websites owned by third parties. We are not responsible for
          the privacy practices or the content of such other websites. These
          links are provided for your convenience and reference only. Analytics:
          As described above, we use third parties to monitor, analyze and
          report on the traffic to, from and within our website and email
          messages.<br /><br />
          How We Use Information Collected<br />
          We use the information we collect from you while you are using the
          Site in a variety of ways, including using the information to
          customize features; advertising that appear on the Site; and, making
          other offers available to you via email, direct mail or otherwise. We
          also may provide your information to third parties, such as service
          providers, contractors and third-party publishers and advertisers for
          a variety of purposes. Unless you inform us in accordance with the
          process described below, we reserve the right to use, and to disclose
          to third parties, all of the information collected from and about you
          while you are using the Site in any way and for any purpose, such as
          to enable us or a third party to provide you with information about
          products and services. If you do not wish your information to be used
          for these purposes, you must send a letter to the Online Privacy
          Coordinator whose address is listed at the end of this Privacy Policy
          requesting to be taken off any lists of information that may be used
          for these purposes or that may be given or sold to third-parties.
          <br /><br /><br />
          Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily make your personal
          information available for viewing by third parties online — for
          example on message boards, web logs, through email, or in chat areas —
          that information can be seen, collected and used by others besides us.
          We cannot be responsible for any unauthorized third-party use of such
          information.
          <br /><br />
          Cooperative Relationships with Third-Party Providers<br />
          Some content, products, or services available on our Site may be
          offered in collaboration with third-party providers. In such cases, we
          may share the information you provide, or that is collected during
          your visit, with our partner. If you have any concerns or questions
          about the privacy policy of one of our partners, please reach out to
          them directly.
